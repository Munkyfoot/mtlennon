                As a Software Developer and Designer with over five years of
                experience, I have evolved from tinkering with HTML and CSS to
                becoming a proficient freelance developer. My career journey is
                marked by a blend of artistic creativity and technical interest,
                culminating in the creation and maintenance of over a dozen
                professional websites. Holding a Bachelor's Degree in Computer
                Science from Western Governors University, I have developed a
                diverse skill set covering front-end and back-end web
                development, game development, and machine learning. My
                technical proficiency spans React/Next.js, ChakraUI, Flask,
                Bootstrap, and a range of languages including Python,
                TypeScript, C#, C++, and Java, coupled with tools like Git.

                My background as a touring musician has imbued me with key soft
                skills such as communication, adaptability, and collaborative
                problem-solving. This experience, alongside my educational
                pursuits including Udacity Nanodegrees in Full Stack Web
                Development, Artificial Intelligence, and C++, has shaped my
                ability to approach challenges innovatively. As a recent
                graduate, I am enthusiastic about contributing to front-end
                development projects, where I can merge my artistic vision with
                my technical skills. I am keen to join a dynamic team, apply my
                creative and technical abilities, and continue growing in the
                fast-paced field of software development.
